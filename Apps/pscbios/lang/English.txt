NOTE 1: After pairing in BlueTool controller is automatically mapped until you unpair it

NOTE 1:Genuine SONY DualShock3 and Sixaxis are supported. Also SHANWAN produced clones should work.

NOTE 2: In case you pair the controller back to PS3 or other console you have to follow this procedure again.

NOTE 3: You do not need to do this procedure in this screen. USB pairing works on any screen as soon console is powered on.

NOTE 4: Pairing information is saved in console, so next time just press PlayStation Home on the controller and it will work in AutoBleem

NOTE: Make sure none of the buttons are pressed before mapping and all analog sticks are in default position.
