If you have Bleemsync installed
**************************	
The AutoBleem Kernel can only be installed on a Playstation Classic that is in its original condition.  If you have 
installed Bleemsync or Project Eris you must first uninstall them.  Restore the backup you made when you installed 
Bleemsync/Eris before installing the AutoBleem Kernel.

Find the backup LBOOT.EPB Bleemsync (or Project Eris) made when you installed Bleemsync or Eris.  Follow the 
MMC uninstall guide outlined here: https://modmyclassic.com/?s=uninstall+project+eris to uninstall Bleemsync 
or Project Eris.

If you installed multiple versions of Bleemsync on top of one another then you need to uninstall them in reverse order.  
For example, if you installed Bleemsync 1.1 and then later installed Bleemsync 1.2 on top of 1.1: 1) Uninstall 
Bleemsync 1.2 using the backup it made during the 1.2 install.  This will restore your PSC to Bleemsync 1.1. 
2) Uninstall Bleemsync 1.1 using the backup it made during the 1.1 install.  This will restore your PSC to the
original state before you installed Bleemsync 1.1.

The AutoBleem kernel will not install on the PSC unless it either is in its original condition or it has been restored 
to its original condition.

If you have lost your Bleemsync backup file
**************************	
Find a friend who has a Playstation Classic in it's original condition.  Ask him to install the Autobleem Kernel.  
During the install process AutoBleem will first make a backup of the original kernel.  You can use that backup 
with AutoBleem to restore your PSC to its original condition.  See below on how to use AutoBleem to restore a 
kernel backup of the PSC that was made by AutoBleem.

DO NOT USE AUTOBLEEM TO RESTORE A BLEEMSYNC BACKUP!  You will brick your PSC!

How to restore a backup made with AutoBleem
**************************	
Important: You are restoring the PSC to original condition.  You MUST format the USB stick as fat32 as it will 
boot back up as an original stock PSC that only supports fat32.

During the kernel installation process Autobleem will first make a backup of your kernel.  You can restore that backup 
(made by AutoBleem) to restore the kernel backup to the PSC.  Place the LBOOT.EPB file created by AutoBleem on 
the root of your AutoBleem USB drive.  Boot AutoBleem on your PSC.  Navigate to Apps and run the ABFashkit App.  
Press the triangle button to start the restore of the LBOOT.EPB file to the PSC.  If you then want to install 
the AutoBleem Kernel press the X button.  The install is very quick.  
Enjoy the features of the new kernel: OTG, NTFS, exFat, easy WiFI setup and automatic WiFi re-connect on boot, 
Ethernet, and datetime features.
