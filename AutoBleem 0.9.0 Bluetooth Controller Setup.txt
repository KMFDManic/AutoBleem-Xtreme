NOTE: Bluetooth support is currently experimental at this point. Some controllers
will work better than others, while some may not work at all. These controllers have
been tested:

1. The Switch Pro controller has worked well in our testing
2. The GameSir G3s controller has worked well in our testing.  Press B and Home to pair.
3. The PlayStation 4 controller mostly works with some minor issues experienced in Evoui
4. The PlayStation 3 controller does not currently work properly but is being worked on

Support for additional controllers will follow in future releases
