AutoBleem 0.9.0 Wifi Setup:

Note: You can use a USB keyboard on the WiFi menu.  This is particularly useful when entering
your WiFi password and for paging down the timezone choices.  Enter = X, Escape = O.

1. At the AutoBleem start screen, press the L1 + Square buttons on the controller. This
will take you to the Playstation Classic Hardware Information screen

2. Press the Select button on the controller to enter Wifi Settings

3. Navigate to SSID and press the Triangle button on the controller to scan for your SSID
Note: If your SSID is not discovered during the scan, manually enter your SSID by pressing X
on the controller to select Edit SSID

4. Navigate to Password and enter your WiFi password

5. Select the appropriate Driver Mode for your wifi dongle. The default setting is wext, which is 
compatible with the 8188eu wifi chipset. The TP-Link TL-WN725N uses this chipset for example.
For other chipsets such as the rt5370, select the nl80211 Driver Mode. Use this driver mode 
for the Railink 5370 for example. It is recommended to try the nl80211 Driver Mode first and only
use the wext Driver Mode if the nl80211 Driver Mode is not compatible with your wifi dongle like
the model noted above.  Although both work, we found that WiFi dongles using the rt5370 chipset 
were more stable than the TL-WN725N chipset.

6. Navigate to the Write Configuration/Restart Network option and press X on the controller 
This will save your WiFi settings to the PSC.

7. Navigate to Timezone and press X on the controller to set your timezone
Note: Restart Network will allow you to reconnect to your network if you have lost connection

Once setup, the AutoBleem kernel will automatically connect to Wifi during boot!

To connect to your PSC using SSH with Putty, use port 22 for SSH.  To connect to your PSC using 
FTP with WinSCP or FileZilla use port 21.  Note: SFTP is not supported.  
The login user name is "root" and the password is "ab".
