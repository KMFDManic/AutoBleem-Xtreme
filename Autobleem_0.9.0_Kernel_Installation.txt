AutoBleem Kernel Installation
**************************	

Please note that following the steps below will modify your consoles firmware which voids your 
warranty. Doing this is not required to use AutoBleem. Only do this if you wish to add OTG, NTFS, exFAT,
WiFi, Ethernet, and experimental Bluetooth support. 

1. Format your USB drive to fat32 and label it SONY. 

2. Install AutoBleem 0.9.0 on your USB drive.

3. The AutoBleem Kernel can only be installed on a Playstation Classic that is in its original condition.  If you have 
installed Bleemsync or Project Eris you must first uninstall them.  See the document on uninstalling Bleemsync or 
Project Eris and restoring a kernel backup.

If your PSC is an unmodified PSC or it has been restored to its original condition then proceed.

4. Remove your USB drive from your PC and insert it into the player 2 controller port on the front of the PSC.

5. Make sure a controller is connected to the player one port on the front the PSC.

6. Connect the power cable to the PSC and wait until the power light turns orange.

7. Press the power button on the PSC. The power light will blink orange then green repeatedly and will eventually 
stop blinking and remain a constant green.

8. At the AutoBleem start screen, press start on the controller.

9. Once in AutoBleem, press select on the controller twice to navigate to Apps.  Navigate to the ABFlashkit App.

10. Start the ABFlashkit App by pressing X on the controller.

11. Read the ABFashkit notes that appear, then press X on the controller.  If you get an error that the PSC is
not in its original condition see the document on uninstalling Bleemsync or Project Eris and restoring from a 
kernel backup.  Then try again.

12. When the process is complete your PSC will boot normally. You now have restored your backup kernel or vanilla 
PSC kernel to the PSC.

14. To install the AutoBleem kernel, navigate to the AutoBleem Apps menu and start the ABFlashkit App, (steps 8-11 above).

15. Press X on the controller to flash the AutoBleem kernel to your PSC. Once the kernel installation has completed 
the screen will go black. Remove and reinsert the power cable to the PSC. Wait for the power light to turn orange, 
then press the power button. 

Congratulations, you have installed AutoBleem 0.9.0 and the AutoBleem kernel!  Enjoy all the features in this new kernel.

*** Please see the AutoBleem 0.9.0 for details about this new release and what features the AutoBleem kernel has added to your PSC.
