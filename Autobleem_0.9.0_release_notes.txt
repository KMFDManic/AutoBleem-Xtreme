                                       Autobleem-0.9.0 Release Notes
                                       *****************************
									   
**************************									   
**** AutoBleem Kernel ****
**************************									   
AutoBleem now has it's own Linux kernel for the Playstation Classic!!!

The new AutoBleem kernel includes support for OTG, RNDIS, easy WiFI setup and auto connect on 
boot (all Linux drivers), Ethernet (all Linux drivers), NTFS and exFat, and experimental Bluetooth support.  

**** Flashing the new Kernel ****
The AutoBleem kernel flasher is VERY easy to use.  The kernel flasher will first backup your existing 
PSC kernel and then quickly flashes the new AutoBleem kernel.  If you have the BleemSync 1.0, 1.1,
1.2, or Project Eris kernel installed on your PSC you must first use Bleemsync or Project 
Eris to restore your PSC back to it's original state.  The AutoBleem kernel flasher will not 
flash the kernel if BleemSync or Project Eris kernel files are still on the PSC.  See the 
separate AB_0.9.0_Kernel_Installation.txt document for instructions.

**** WiFi ****
Setting up WiFi is also very easy.  Go to the Network App or the Advanced menu (press L1 
then Square).  AutoBleem will scan the WiFi network for the SSID's of nearby WiFi networks.  
Simply select your SSID from the list.  Enter the SSID WiFi password.  After the network is 
initialized (WiFi and/or Ethernet) the I.P. addresses are displayed.  Set your time zone.  
AutoBleem will then set the current date and time on your PSC.  Once setup, WiFi will 
automatically reconnect on every boot!  See the WiFi setup document for more details.

**** Date and time ****
If WiFi or Ethernet has been setup AutoBleem will automatically set the current date and time 
on the Playstation Classic from the internet.  If the date and time are set AutoBleem will save
and display the last time a game was played on the PS1 Game carousel.  If you want to change 
the date time display format edit the "Datetimeformat" setting in Autobleem/bin/autobleem/config.ini.  
See http://www.cplusplus.com/reference/ctime/strftime/ for date time format strings.

NOTE: Pressing L1 + Square while at the AutoBleem start screen will take you directly to 
the AutoBleem Kernel Bios Hardware Infomation App.  This will display your PSC hardware 
information including the WiFi and/or Ethernet connection IP address and the current date 
and time.  This menu display is only available if you have flashed the AutoBleem Kernel 
to your PSC.

**** Bluetooth ****
Bluetooth is experimental in this release.  The Switch Pro controller works.
The AutoBleem team will continue to work on supporting more Bluetooth and USB controllers for
future releases.  See the separate document on how to pair a controller to the PSC with Bluetooth.

*****************************************
**** RetroBoot and Emulation Station ****
*****************************************
RetroBoot 1.1 is built into AutoBleem.  
RetroBoot 1.1 includes Emulation station!!!  You can start Emulation Station from the applications folder in 
Retroarch.  You can switch back in the ports section in ES.

                                       Autobleem-0.8.7 Release Notes
                                       *****************************

**** RetroBoot 1.0.1 ****
RetroBoot 1.0.1 is integrated into AutoBleem 0.8.7.

**** Apps ****
Wolfenstein 3D, Tyrian, Prince of Persia, and Duke Nukem 3D have been added to the Apps directory.

When configuring a new controller and you make a mistake you can try again by pressing Circle (cancel).

Instead of needing to know if your controller DPAD is analogue or digital you can 
just press any DPAD button.

If no image is found in Named_Boxarts for a Retroarch game Autobleem will look in Named_Titles 
and then Named_Snaps.

Fast Forward through the next/prev game first letters in the carousel by holding down L1 or R1.

There is now a PS1 Game History selection item in the game directory selection menu.  
(Similar to the RetroArch game history.)

**** Keyboard editor screen ****
Before the cursor was only displayed at the end of the line.  To change a character 
at the front string you had to delete the entire string (a game name for example), and
retype the entire string.  Holding down the L2 button allows you to move the cursor position.

USB keyboards are now supported in the keyboard editor.  This allows you to enter characters 
from your keyboard that aren't on the display.  Press any key on the USB keyboard and the
keyboard display goes away and you can edit the string directly using your USB keyboard.
Backspace, delete, and the arrow keys can be used.  Enter is the same as pressing X and
escape is the same as pressing Circle (cancel). Tab will go back to entering characters 
with the controller.

**** Fast Forward in most menus ***
You can hold down a left/right/up/down joystick button to fast forward through the selections.

**** Other menu improvements ****
L1/R1 will move one page at a time in vertical menus.
L2/R2 will move to the top or bottom of vertical menus.
L1/R1 will move by multiple items in horizontal menus (themes, languages, etc)
L2/R2 will move to the first or last menu item.

**** USB Keyboard support ****
USB keyboard support is available in most menus.  Cursor keys, home, end, page up, and page down.
Enter is the same as pressing X.  Escape is the same as pressing Circle (cancel).

**** Random Game, Theme, or Music ****
While viewing the game carousel press Start to select a random game.
While in the Options Menu, press Start in the theme list to select a random theme.
While in the Options Menu, press Start in the music list to select a random music track.

**** Applications ****
Applications!  Press Select until you get to the Apps selection.  There are four 
Applications in 0.8.5 - The Amiberry Amiga game emulator, the Doom Shareware App, 
the OpenBOR (Open Beats of Rage) emulator, and Retroboot.  

**** Doom ****
Doom - if you own copies of Doom you can add additional level maps by copying the 
doom WAD files to the /Apps/doom directory on your USB stick.

**** OpenBor ****
OpenBOR - to add OpenBOR games copy the OpenBOR PAK files to 
\Apps\openbor\OpenBOR\Paks.

**** Amiberry ****
Amiberry is for advanced users and requires a bios.

KMFDManic has collaborated with screemer on optimization and performance for 
OpenBOR/Amiberry Applications.  KMFD will continue to collaborate in future 
Releases with Screemer, Axanar, and the rest of the AutoBleem Team, to bring 
forth new surprise additions!  Demonstrations of both emulators, in action, 
can be seen on his YouTube Channel:

https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCoRrbw6gyi4KRPGUNnVVjMQ

Cores that run with AutoBleem and RetroBoot and his own Xtreme AB Injector 
are also provided by KMFD.  You are welcome to ping him in our Discord, as 
well as refer to his Release Page for any troubleshooting.  Genderbent and 
KMFD also collaborate on the harmonious union of RetroArch and the Cores.  
Again, feel free to ping any of them, if you need any direct assistance!

https://github.com/KMFDManic/NESC-SNESC-Modifications/releases

Note 1: OpenBOR simply requires you place .paks within the 
Apps/openbor/OpenBOR/Paks Folder.  ONE single Pak will auto load.  Multiple 
will prompt a pull down list.  On KMFD's Google Drive Link, you can refresh 
and check back in Xtras/Games/OpenBOR for some nifty surprises to peruse 
with said Emulator!  More Games will be added, including a special Xmas Bonus 
Game, specifically fixed up to work on the Mini Classics, courtesy of the 
debugging, troubleshooting, collaboration of Douglas Baldan and KMFDManic.

Note 2: Amiberry is a very advanced Emulator (BIOS Required!), of which KMFD 
will be doing a Video Tutorial on, to help you get going on!

**** Select Screen Changes ****
The multiple select button screens have been reduced to three select states.  
1) PS1 Games, 2) Retroarch games, 3) Applications.  When the PS1 Game carousel 
is selected L2 + Select will display a menu of PS1 categories to choose from.  
If "Show Internal Games" is enabled in the UI Options then the categories are 
"All Games", Internal Games, "USB Game Directory, and "Favorites".  If 
Favorites is selected, internal games are included in the favorites list.  If 
"Show Internal Games" is off in the UI Options then the categories are "Game 
Directory, and "Favorites".    If Favorites is selected, internal games are 
not included in the favorites list.  The Favorites selection is at the end 
of the menu (like they are in the Retroarch playlist).

**** Retroarch History ****
The Retroarch playlist menu now includes the Retroarch History playlist.  
The Favorites and History playlist selections are at the end of the playlist 
menu.  When the Retroarch carousel is displayed pressing L2 + Select brings 
up the playlist selection menu.

                                       Autobleem-0.8.1 Release Notes
                                       *****************************

Fixes two problems in 0.8.0.

1) Fixes a crash when you start Evo UI if the /Games directory is empty.

2) Fixes always forcing a rescan if there are games that failed the verify 
   step and were removed from the game list display.

In addition Autobleem now splashes a message on screen if a game fails the 
verify.  The reason or reasons the game failed to verify are also output to 
/Autobleem/bin/autobleem/gamesThatFailedVerifyCheck.txt.

                                       Autobleem-0.8.0 Release Notes
                                       *****************************

USB Games sub-directories
-------------------------
Games can be organized into a directory hierarchy under /Games.  For example, you can organize your sports games under /Games/Sports and you can further organize your sports games into /Games/Sports/Baseball, /Games/Sports/Football, /Games/Sports/Soccer, etc.

You can select the /Games sub-directory you wish to view by pressing the L2 + Select buttons while viewing the game sub-dir carousel.  When you select a game directory you will see all the games in that directory plus all the games in it's sub-directories. Using the example above if you select /Games/Sports/Football you will see only football games.  If you select /Games/Sports you will see ALL sports games (any games in /Games/Sports itself plus all the games in the Sports sub-directories combined).

If you have duplicate games in more than one sub-directory you will only see one of those games in the carousel.  Autobleem will display the game that is in the highest level directory.  So if you have the same football game in /Games/Sports and in /Games/Sports/Football the game shown in the carousel will be the game in /Games/Sports.

Four text files are generated during the scan for additional user information.  They are found in the directory Autobleem/bin/autobleem

gameHierarchy_beforeScan.txt:
The list of games in each /Games directory of your USB drive.  This list is before invalid games are removed and before duplicate games are removed from the carousel display list.

gameHierarchy_afterScanAndRemovingDuplicates.txt:
The list of remaining games that will be displayed in the carousel after removing duplicate games.

duplicateGames.txt:
The list of duplicate games.

gamesThatFailedVerifyCheck.txt:
Invalid games that are removed from the carousel lists.

Press L2 + Select to change the directory you wish to view in the carousel.  You can only change the directory when the USB Game Directory carousel display is up.  (Similarly, Press L2 + Select to change the Retroarch game system playlist when the Retroarch carousel display is up.)

Consolidated Themes
-------------------
The data for a theme is no longer split between /Autobleem/bin/autobleem/theme and /Themes.  All theme data for a theme is contained in one directory under /Themes.  This will make it easier both for theme creators and for users to add a new theme.  You only have one directory to drag and drop the theme to: /Themes.  Axanar will release a collection of themes with all the theme data merged into /Themes.  Simply drag and drop the themes you want into /Themes.

Since the files for a theme only need to copied to one directory (/Themes) there is only one options menu item needed to change themes.

Deleting a game
---------------
You can now delete a game from within the game manager menu.  If the game is the last copy of the game on the USB Autobleem will ask you if you also wish to delete the !SaveStates for that game.

Internal game favorites
------------------------
Internal games can now be set as a favorite and will show up in the Favorites carousel.  The internal favorite data is contained in /System/Databases/internal.db if you wish to save or copy your internal favorites to another USB.

Retroarch favorites
-------------------
Retroarch favorites are now listed as a RA playlist at the bottom of the RA playlist menu.  You can select the Favorites playlist to see only your RA favorite games in the game carousel.  RA games are set as a favorite in Retroarch not in the Autobleem UI.

Retroboot 0.10.1
----------------------------
Autobleem 0.8.0 has Retroboot 0.10.1 for Autobleem pre-installed.
