                This is a "generic" Sierra sound driver that will drive
                any multi-timbral sound module.  Also required is an MPU
                compatible interface.  This driver generates MIDI on all
                channels, but here is the breakdown:

                        channel     use
                        -------     ----------------
                           1        Single voice (attention DX7 owners)
                         2 - 9      Multi-timbral channels
                          10        Rhythm channel (Roland MT-32 key assigns)
                          11        Additional single voice
                          12        Additional single voice

                Simply copy the GNRCSND.DRV file to your game disk one or
                hard disk and reinstall.  You should see a new selection
                for "Generic Multi-timbral Sound Module".

                This driver will not generate any program change commands
                or system exclusive messages.
