         SECTION 1     Basic Instructions on enabling cheats in MAME
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

What to do with the cheat.dat file file :-

Step 1 (what to do with the cheat.dat file )
============================================

First of all unzip the cheat.dat file into the same directory as where the
MAME.EXE is (All platforms apart from Mac OS 9/X ).

For MacMAME the cheat.dat file should be in:-
${HOME}/Documents/MacMAME User Data/Misc Support Files

For MAME OS X the cheat.dat file should be in:-
${HOME}/Library/Application Support/MAME OS X


Step 2 (Enable the MAME Cheat Engine)
=====================================

As standard the MAME Cheat Engine is turned OFF, there are several ways of
turning it ON depending on which platform you are running MAME on.

MAMEW:  This is the standard MAME command line compile, go to your MAME
        directory open up the MAME.INI file with a text editor (the one you
        are using to read this will probably do!).
          Find '### Mame CORE misc options ###' and change 'cheat 0' to
        'cheat 1'. Note: If your MAME.EXE is named something else like
        MAME067.EXE then you will need to edit MAME067.INI rather than
        MAME.INI!
          If you have no INI file then just start MAME from the command-line
        with the -createconfig option  eg. 'MAME -createconfig'. If you
        manually use MAME every time from the command-line you can also
        just add '-cheat' to the command line.

MAME32: This is the MAME with build in frontend compile for Windows. Go to
        the Options Menu, and select "Default Options". Go to the
        Miscellaneous tab and check the box that says "Enable Game Cheats".

DMAME:  This is the DOS MAME compile, go to your MAME directory open up the
        MAME.CFG file with a text editor (the one you are using to read this
        will probably do!).
          Find 'cheat off' and change it to 'cheat on'. Note: If your
        MAME.EXE is named something else like MAME067.EXE then you will need
        to edit MAME067.CFG rather than MAME.CFG! If you have no CFG file
        then just start MAME from the command-line with the -createconfig
        option eg. 'MAME -createconfig'. If you manually use MAME every time
        from the command-line you can also just add '-cheat' to the
        command-line.

UNIX:   For the UNIX/LINUX compiles just follow the instructions for DMAME
        the DOS compile.

OS9/X:  From the front-end, go to the Misc tab, and check the box that says
        "Allow Cheats".


Step 3 (Cheat!)
===============

In-game press TAB and follow your nose......
Left and Right cursor toggles cheats ON and OFF, ENTER turns on one shot cheats
and SHIFT ENTER displays the cheat comments if there are any (the ON/OFF/SET
will be in reverse video if there are any comments).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                 SECTION 2     Cheat Description Meanings
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

GENERAL NOTES ABOUT CHEAT DESCRIPTIONS AND WHAT THEY MEAN:
----------------------------------------------------------
NOTES: The cheat descriptions use the following terms, this is what they
       actually mean:

Get+Now! means the cheat is a type 00000001 cheat and so it is a temporary cheat -
         it changes the memory and then deactivates. Type 01 is ideal for
         getting a particular weapon or feature, also needed for a Finish
         Level Now! cheat.

Always   means the cheat is permanent (several cheat types) idea for always
         having a certain weapon or feature eg always have 3 rainbows on
         Rainbow Islands.

Infinite means exactly what it says - you will have an inexhaustible supply of
         the named item be it lives, time, ammo or something else. On some
         rare occasions you may need to deactivate the cheat before you can
         finish a level, if this need to be done you will see F6 at the end
         of the cheat description.

Select current level  - Select a level and you can progress to it by losing a
                        life. You should only activate this type of cheat
                        during game play or according to the comments.

Select next level - Select a level and when you complete the current level you
                    will progress straight to the selected level. You can also
                    activate this on the title/attract screens though the
                    effects cannot always be guaranteed! (you will either
                    start on the selected level or the next level after the
                    selected one or level 1). A far better method if you want
                    to select the starting level from the title screen is to
                    use the method that I thought of for Metrocross. See
                    Metrocross remarks for info.

Select Score - This cheat allows you to select your score or/and the other
               player's score, ideal for sports games where you need a certain
               score to win and/or progress. It must ONLY be activated during
               game play. Also note the score may not display correctly until
               the score has changed properly!


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                       SECTION 3     Cheat Ordering
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is how I order the cheats - I try and stick to it as often as I can.
Some games don't conform to this standard either because it's better as is or
the cheats were done a while ago and I haven't changed them. DO NOT report any
games that don't follow this standard - it's pretty low on the list of
priorities right now.

OVERALL CHEAT ORDER
-------------------

gamename in format '; [ long game name ]'
section1
section2
section3 (if applicable)
section4

WHAT'S EACH SECTION ABOUT?
--------------------------

Section 1 contains all the cheats valid for all players. Infinite Credits will
come first normally.

Section 2 contains cheats for individual players, split up so that all PL1
cheats are together and all PL2 cheats are together. Normally there will be the
same cheats for each player and the order of the cheats should be the same as
for the other player.

Section 3 contains cheats that are hard to button-hole and have fairly obscure
effects on the game that only the die-hard player of that game may really want.
These sort of cheats can often be merged into section 2, though in some
circumstances the sheer number of these cheats will seriously clutter out the
normal everyday cheats (section 2). In that case they should be separated into
another section and the PL1 / PL2 separation in that section should be maintained
if possible.

Section 4 contains any none cheat related things. Eg. Sound test timer and region
switch  codes.

WHAT'S IN EACH SECTION
----------------------

The normal order of cheats will be if there is no PL1 or PL2 specific cheats.
If a cheat is specific to all players it will promote it up the list.

Infinite Credits
Infinite Time       (if 'Finish this Round Now!' is worthwhile it should
                     directly follow this cheat)
Infinite Lives
Infinite Energy     (if 'Drain all Energy Now!' is worthwhile it should
                     directly follow this cheat)
Infinite Ammo
Infinite Bombs
Invincibility       (if Invincibility doesn't turn off after a short while of
                     disabling it then there should be separate 'ON' and 'OFF'
                     cheats)
Always have this weapon
Get this weapon Now!
Play with this character Now!
Select starting level
Select current level
Select next level

SPACING/BLANK COMMENTS
----------------------

Blank Comment cheats should be added to improve the readability of the cheats
in the cheat engine were appropriate. 

There should be a blank after section 1 if section 2 has 3 or more cheat entries
for each player OR if section 1 has itself got three or more cheat entries.

If there are 3 or more cheat entries for each player in section 2 then the 
entries for each player should be seperated with a blank comment.

If section 3 exists it should ideally be preceded by a blank comment.

If section 4 exists it should ideally be preceded by a blank comment.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        SECTION 4     Cheat Engine Commands (to customise the cheat UI)
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Cheat Engine Commands:
----------------------

These special cheat lines are used to set global preferences for the cheat
engine. If you don't understand binary then you really shouldn't be
messing with it. Here is a slightly techie description

    LSB
0000000
6543210
------0  Cheat AutoSave = OFF
------1  Cheat AutoSave = ON (Recommended)
----00-  Search Box Style = Minimum
----01-  Search Box Style = Classic (Recommended)
----10-  Search Box Style = Advanced
---0---  Search Labels = Show
---1---  Search Labels = Hide (Recommended)
--0----  Activation Key Message = OFF
--1----  Activation Key Message = ON (Recommended)
-0-----  Old Cheat Format Support = OFF
-1-----  Old Cheat Format Support = ON (Recommended)
0------  Cheat Engine Debug Mode = OFF (Recommended)
1------  Cheat Engine Debug Mode = ON (Don't bother!)


So to have the recommended settings we will have Binary 0111011 which if we put
into the Windows Calculator (in Scientific Mode) with the BIN button selected
and then convert the number to HEX (by pressing the HEX button) we will get 3B.

So just add this into the cheat.dat file for the required options:-

:_command:0000003B

To keep things simple this is already included in the cheat.dat file as standard, so if
you are not happy with any of the settings then please change it.



------------------------------------------------------------------------------
                  SECTION 5     Cheat Format Information
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

CHEAT FORMAT INFORMATION
------------------------

The cheat format is very powerful, though the sheer number of options make it
hard to understand. On a whole cheats using the cheat format are best made by
setting the appropriate options on the edit cheat page and then saving the said
cheat. There are some exceptions though - as occasionally it's harder if not
impossible to do exactly what you want using the edit function. This
information will hopefully help you understand the cheat format.

Cheat Format:
-------------

This section is based heavily on the information found in cheat.c. I've just
edited it to make it a tad easier for me to understand, in fact the act of
editing this helped me a lot.

3. Cheat Type Field in hexadecimal (how to poke)
4. Address in Hexadecimal (where to poke)

Persistence
-------- -------- -------- -------0 the cheat is poked with respect to the
                                    Normal/Delay options and the cheat remains
                                    in the active list

                                    specified value which should be inside the
                                    range. If 24/32 bits then the Extended data

Extended Data Field:
--------------------

 [ Write with Mask ]  The field will store a mask containing which bits are
                      modified by the operation. For normal operation, set the
                      mask to 0xFFFFFFFF and only change it if you actually
                      need to!
                      Example code: data = (data & ~mask) | (input & mask);

 [ Force Range ]      This field will store the allowed range of values, or
                      the limit value (if a 24 or 32 bit value is being poked)

                      8 bit writes:    0x0000AABB
                      16 bit writes:   0xAAAABBBB
                      24 bit writes:   0x00CCCCCC
                      32 bit writes:   0xCCCCCCCC

                      AA = minimum value accepted.
                      BB = maximum value accepted.
                      CC = limit value, operation parameters selects max or min
                           limit.

 [ Add/Subtract ]     The field will store either the minimum or maximum
                      boundary for modification, depending on the operation
                      parameter.

 [ Relative Address ] The extend data field will store the the signed offset to
                      be applied to the address read. Because of this, any
                      operation using the extend data field may have
                      interesting results. Use the special set/clear bits
                      operations instead of a masked write.

Information About the New Types of Cheats:
------------------------------------------

Select Cheat Type: (01100010 -------0 -------- --------) 0x62000000

                      This may be used only as the first cheat of a linked
                      cheat. In the "Enable/Disable Cheat" menu, instead of
                      simple listing On/Off or Set as the menu option, the
                      cheat engine will list the name fields of each of the
                      sub-cheats. If the current selected sub-cheat is a one-shot
                      cheat, pressing Enter will activate the currently
                      selected sub-cheat. If the sub-cheat is an on/off cheat,
                      the currently selected sub-cheat (and only that sub cheat)
                      will be activated.

Assign Activation Key: (01100011 -------- -1------ --------) 0x63004000

                      Assigns an activation key to a cheat. Put the index of

Overclock: (01100101 -------- -1------ --------) 0x65004000

                      Overclocks a CPU. Put the CPU index you want in the
                      address field, and the overclocking amount in the data
                      field. Use 16.16 fixed point notation for the
                      overclocking amount.

                      Example 1: overclocking CPU #0 by 200%
                      :gamename:65004000:00000000:00020000:00000000:

                      Example 2: overclocking CPU #3 by 125%
                      :gamename:65004000:00000003:00014000:00000000:

                      To convert a percent to 16.16 fixed point notation, take
                      the percentage as a decimal value (eg. 65% = .65) and
                      multiply it by 65536. Then, convert the value to hex.


Watches:
--------

You can specify options for watches using the data field. Specify fields like
this:

MSB                             LSB
33222222 22221111 11111100 00000000
10987654 32109876 54321098 76543210
-------- -------- -------- xxxxxxxx number of elements - 1
-------- -------- xxxxxxxx -------- bytes to skip after each element
-------- xxxxxxxx -------- -------- elements per line
                                    0 = all on one line
xxxxxxxx -------- -------- -------- signed value to add

So, to make a watch on CPU1 address 0064407F with six elements, skipping three
bytes after each element, showing two elements per line, you would do this:

:gamename:00000006:0064407F:00020305:00000000:

Notes:

- if you want to have a list of many on/off sub-cheats, include a "None" option,
  or there will be no way to disable the cheat
- the engine will display "Press Enter to Activate Cheat" if a one-shot cheat
  is selected

              SECTION 6     How to Pre-Enable cheats
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Pre-Enable: (01100100 -------- -1------ --------) 0x64004000

Enables a cheat on startup. Put the index of the cheat you want to enable in
the address field.

Example, to activate the eleventh cheat in the cheat list, add this cheat to
the file:

:gamename:64004000:0000000A:00000000:00000000:

Actual Example:
For the game Marble Madness, add this to the end of your cheat file it must be
the end of the cheat file or it won't work!

:marble:64004000:00000004:00000000:00000000:
:marble:64004000:00000007:00000000:00000000:

If you've done it correctly the above two lines will automatically enable
cheat lines 5 and 8 for that game which at the time of writing will give
Infinite Time for both players.

NOTE: The cheat lines are counted in hexadecimal not in decimal and the first
      cheat line is 0, the 9th is 08, 11th is 0A etc. You should ignore all
      other cheats in a linked list or linked cheat other than the first cheat.
      All other cheats including comment cheats should be counted though


The pre-enabled cheats should be placed in the Pre-Enabled Cheat Section near the 
end of the cheat.dat file. Below is a semi-full list of example pre-enabling cheats
for the game with the shortname "gamename". 

Just remember if you're pre-enabling cheats that you will need to copy any
pre-enabling cheats you have made to future cheat files, if you just copy over
the new cheat.dat file you will lose any pre-enabling cheats you have made.
Also bear in mind that the cheat order in the cheat file can be changed between
updates due to new cheats being added, buggy cheats being removed or the cheats
just being re-arranged. Of course if the mamedevs change the shortname you will
have to compensate for that too. All things considered unless you know what you
are doing just stick to enabling cheats manually when you play the game.

REMEMBER THOUGH IF YOU PRE-ENABLE CHEATS FOR SOME GAMES IT WILL CAUSE THE GAME
TO FAIL IT'S RAM/ROM CHECKING AND THE GAME MAY NOT START. IN THESE CASES CHECK
TO SEE IF THERE ARE ANY CHEATS TO BYPASS THESE CHECKS AND IF THERE ARE THEN
PRE-ENABLE THOSE CHEATS. OTHERWISE YOU CAN TEMPORARILY TURN OFF ALL CHEATS
USING F6, RESET THE GAME AND THEN PRESS F6 AGAIN TO TURN ON ALL YOUR
PRE-ENABLED CHEATS.

Copy and paste which cheats above you need and change the gamename accordingly,
it might be an idea to change the comment so that you know what's being
pre-enabled though. Note if you want to pre-enable your own cheats not in this
cheat file you must make sure that the pre-enabling cheats are AFTER your own
cheats!

 Example for Marble Madness:-
:marble:64004000:000004:00000000:00000000:Pre-Enable the 005th cheat in the list:Pre-enabled Infinite Time PL1
:marble:64004000:000007:00000000:00000000:Pre-Enable the 008th cheat in the list:Pre-enabled Infinite Time PL2

                   SECTION 7     Dynamic Cheat Finding method
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Dynamic Cheat Finding method by Pugsy
-------------------------------------

From the start, this is presuming you are using a debug MAME. I'm using samsho2
as an example and I am looking for infinite energy for PL1 - the method is easy
to alter for different games and/or other things (this is mainly a method used
for neogeo games - the only real system that utilises dynamic addressing for
'useful' locations). It's not a method for beginners, it assumes cheat finding
skills, a basic understanding of hexadecimal addressing and an ability to
decode my waffling.



1. Start MAME as you would normally - don't forget you must use the debug MAME
   build with either -debug on the command-line or DEBUG 1 in the ini file.

2. You will find that after a short while MAME will be on the debugger screen,
   at this stage just press F12 to start the game. [REMEMBER F12 in the
   debugger will return you to the game]

3. Commence play

4. Start a Energy Search and reduce the results using standard methods. In the
   example I reduced the results to 2 possibles 100AC6 & 10373B, by using
   watches I can discount 100AC6 as it's the time location. So that leaves us
   with 10373B 80 = Full Energy. NOTE: You have to find the value as quickly as
   possible because the location will change the next time the level changes,
   so you would have to start the search from the beginning. You can test the
   address you find by poking it directly if it's the correct location you will
   find it will have the desired affect on that level.

5. Press the tilde key (the tilde key is the key under Esc and about TAB and
   the the left of 1). You will now be in the debugger, remember the fact that
   we found the address 0010373B in step 4 (Note the preceding 0s - we will
   need them).

6. Press TAB 3 times so that the cursor is in the address window. Now press S
   to commence a search and type in the value as per step 5...but drop the last
   byte as that will be part of the index. So in this case we would type in 00
   10 37, then press RETURN to execute the search - you can repeat the search
   by  pressing S and hitting RETURN (the last search values are still set).
   For every search result note down the address, you can safely ignore any
   results in ROM locations or where it crosses word boundaries (ie. it shows as
   XX00 1037 instead of 0010 37XX). In this example you will find that
   S 00 10 37  only returns one ROM location at 00003680, so we can safely
   ignore it. However, there are no other occurrences so we are goosed.....or
   are we?

7. If there are no possibilities then remember that the location we are looking
   for contains an address that hopefully points to a page of memory limited in
   size. In most cases this seems to be no greater than 256 bytes and is mostly
   forward indexed (+ve rather than -ve). So assuming that 10373B is the
   extreme case it is 256 bytes away from the start of the memory page base
   location, then the base location of the page would be 10363C. So we need to
   repeat Step 6 but this time with S 00 10 36 as the search instruction,
   ignoring ROM locations and word boundary crossing, from this we get the
   following results:-

   Address     Contents
   100A46       00103680
   100A5E       00103680
   102AEC       00103680
   102D2C       00103680
   103F2C       00103680
   10404C       00103680
   104DCC       00103680
   10500C       00103680
   1057EC       00103680
   105A2C       00103680
   105C6C       00103680
   10644C       00103680

8. From the Step 7 results you can see that all the results point to a page of
   memory starting at 00103680, since we know the energy location is 0010373B
   we can work out that the index value is = BB (Cheat Location - Start Address
   of page = 10373B -103680).

9. Now you need to narrow the location down either by loads of watches on
   several levels or by excessive testing, personally I place a watch on all
   the locations and try the first location first, second location second etc
   etc. [ NOTE: A lot of neogeo games which utilise dynamic addressing seem to
   like to use a value in the range 100AXX as the pointer location. ] Here are
   the cheats to try first...

   :samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 1]
   :samsho2:83000000:00100A5E:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 2]
   :samsho2:83000000:00102AEC:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 3]
   :samsho2:83000000:00102D2C:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1 [POSSIBILITY NO. 4]

   { One more interesting thing to note, you may find that several locations
     will have the desired affect as the pointers maybe held in several places
     in memory, it really doesn't matter which one you use. }

10. Once you find out the location which works bear in mind that the game will
    use the same page for other things like Power etc, Note PL2 will generally
    use a different page though the location holding the pointer is generally
    right next to the pointer for the other Player (the index will generally be
    the same though...which is nice :) ).

For samsho2 we hence have these dynamic cheats:-

:samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL1
:samsho2:83000001:00100A46:00000000:000000BB:Drain All Energy Now! PL1
:samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000020:000000F0:Always have Maximum Power PL1
:samsho2:83000000:00100A46:00000000:000000F0:Always have Minimum Power PL1
:samsho2:83000000:00100A4A:00000080:000000BB:Infinite Energy PL2
:samsho2:83000001:00100A4A:00000000:000000BB:Drain All Energy Now! PL2
:samsho2:83000000:00100A4A:00000020:000000F0:Always have Maximum Power PL2
:samsho2:83000000:00100A4A:00000000:000000F0:Always have Minimum Power PL2

             SECTION 9     Games utilising ROM cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Games utilising ROM cheats, where the cheat actually changes the program code
rather than the game data. Individual credits will be given due to the extra
work and skill - though only for cheats where RAM cheats are either not
possible or buggy! Sometimes it is actually a LOT quicker to make a ROM hack
than find a RAM cheat.

I'm keeping this list as I may find it useful to for testing purposes when the
cheat engine changes...especially for processors with endian (big and little)
issues. As new clones are added I will add the cheats and give credit to the
original author for the clones as long as the conversions are relatively
straightforward.

   SECTION 10     Games utilising EEPROM/Mapped Memory cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of games that currently make use of cheats that poke direct to
mapped memory or EEPROM. Generally these cheats are to reveal game functions
such as hidden game characters. Note: If the mapped memory being poked is
actually program code it is classed as a ROM cheat!

       SECTION 11     Games utilising Forced Range cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of the games currently make use of the force range type cheat as
added in the new cheat engine. It basically allows you to take a location and
make sure that the value stays within a range of values. An example is Arkanoid
where by finding the Y pos of the ball sprite we can ensure by a simple cheat
that the ball never leaves the playing area as soon as it attempts to we poke
the location with a value which will effectively push the ball up a bit so that
you can have another go at hitting the ball. They will hopefully used more in
future as people understand them.

SECTION 12   Games utilising Dynamic (Relative Addressing) cheats with credits
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This is a list of games that currently use 'dynamic' cheats. Dynamic cheats
are basically just relative addressed cheats. The problem with some games when
you do a cheat search is that you can easily find for example the energy
location and poking it will seem to work fine, but if you advance a level you
will find that the cheat no longer works. In fact the next time you play the
level you found the cheat for you will probably find that the cheat doesn't
work there either. I've included my method of how to find your own 'dynamic'
cheats under this list...enjoy ;-) Again this list is sorted in the order that
cheats were added (oldest cheats first).

Don't expect this list to change too much - there's more pressing issues for
me to deal with normally - I do have a crack at them occasionally.

Look at replicating Mania Challenge cheats for The Main Event
The Return of Ishtar needs more work - present cheats has problems in b12 ...
More codes for 88 Games
I, Robot more codes needed
Baluba-louk no Densetsu more codes?
Knock Out/Triple Punch - Look at the invincibility cheats
My Hero - Round Select codes
Syougi No Tatsujin - more cheats?
Flash Gal - check for level select cheats
Cosmo Gang the Video - check out both versions unsure which is NOW the original
one the cheat was made for.
Look at Fatal Fury 4 cheats - rename add more?
Body Slam - room for lots more cheats, see other wrestling games for possible cheats
More cheats for Big Pro Wrestling! needed
More cheats for Yosaku To Donbee
Add Select score cheats for the Super Sidekicks series of games

More cheats for invad2ct - Space Invaders II

Air Buster - possible trigger cheat missing from Side shot, Powerball & B cheats. Investigate
Soldam (Japan) - possibility of a lot more colour related cheats, + needs some other cheats
U.S. Classic - more cheats required, PL2 cheats not yet possible! (beta 1)
raphero game is a clone, but more cheats here than for the others  bigbang&tdragon2 (maybe the raphero cheats can be replicated)
tmekprot - there's more cheats for tmek, though the cheats don't seem to exist for tmekprot (look into program code)
mslug4 & clone - look at cheats, weapon cheats appear not to work properly
